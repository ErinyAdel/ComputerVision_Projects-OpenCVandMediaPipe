Canny Edgy Detection: 
    1. Converts image to gray scale by using equation: y = 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B
    2. Removes the noises from the image by using "Gaussian filter"
    3. Use SobelX, SobelY to get the edges in two directions and combine them by using equation: Edge_Gradient(G) = Sqr(Gx^2 + Gy^2)    
    4. Apply Non-maximum suppression to make the edges thin by using equation: Angle(Î˜) = tan ^-1 (Gy / Gx)
    5. Hysteresis thresholding to connect the strong edges and ignore other
